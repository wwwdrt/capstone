### Tech Stack <a name="tech-stack"></a>

> For this project, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I had the option to use a CSS framework, and I chose Tailwind due to its flexibility and full customizability. In contrast to other frameworks like Bootstrap, I found that Tailwind offers more creative freedom. One great aspect of Tailwind is that you can use it in conjunction with other frameworks, such as by creating a layout component and overriding the existing Bootstrap component styles with Tailwind's apply directive and classes.
